          Policy Statement: [Loop of Infinity] is committed to maintaining a
          strong and effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program to prevent
          the use of our platform for illicit activities. We strictly adhere to
          all applicable laws and regulations related to anti-money laundering,
          terrorist financing, and other illicit activities. This policy
          outlines our commitment to establishing robust AML controls and
          procedures to detect, prevent, and report suspicious activities.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Risk-Based Approach: We employ a risk-based approach to assess the
            potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated
            with our platform. This includes conducting thorough risk
            assessments and applying appropriate levels of due diligence based
            on the identified risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Prior to onboarding users, we will
            perform comprehensive customer due diligence checks. This process
            includes verifying the identity of users, collecting necessary
            identification documents, and assessing the risk profile of each
            customer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transaction Monitoring: We have implemented robust transaction
            monitoring systems to detect and analyze suspicious or potentially
            illicit activities. This includes monitoring for unusual transaction
            patterns, high-value transactions, and other red flags indicative of
            money laundering or terrorist financing
          </li>
          <li>
            Suspicious Activity Reporting: If we identify any suspicious
            activities or transactions that may be linked to money laundering,
            terrorist financing, or other criminal activities, we will promptly
            report such instances to the relevant authorities as required by law
          </li>
          <li>
            Training and Awareness: We provide ongoing training and education to
            our employees to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and
            are equipped to identify and report suspicious activities. This
            includes regular AML training programs and updates to keep our staff
            informed of emerging risks and regulatory changes
          </li>
          <li>
            Record Keeping: We maintain proper records of customer
            identification, transaction data, and all other relevant information
            as required by applicable laws and regulations. These records are
            securely stored and made available to regulatory authorities upon
            request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance Monitoring and Review: We conduct regular internal
            reviews and assessments of our AML program to ensure its
            effectiveness and compliance with regulatory requirements. External
            audits may also be conducted to validate the adequacy of our AML
            controls.

          <li>
            Non-Tolerance for Money Laundering: [Loop Of Infinity] has a
            zero-tolerance policy for any involvement in money laundering,
            terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. We will take
            appropriate actions, including terminating relationships and
            cooperating with law enforcement authorities, in cases where such
            activities are detected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance with Laws and Regulations: [Loop Of Infinity] will comply
            with all relevant local and international laws and regulations
            pertaining to anti-money laundering, including but not limited to
